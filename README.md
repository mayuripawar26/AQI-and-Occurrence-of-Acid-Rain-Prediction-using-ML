# AQI-and-Occurrence-of-Acid-Rain-Prediction-using-ML
The "AQI and Occurrence Acid Rain Prediction Using ML - Data Analysis" project is a data-centric initiative aimed at harnessing the potential of Machine Learning (ML) to predict both the Air Quality Index (AQI) and the occurrence of acid rain through in-depth data analysis.
This project recognizes the increasing importance of data-driven insights for environmental monitoring and its critical role in safeguarding public health and the environment.

STEPS in data analysis: 

Data Collection and Aggregation
Feature Engineering
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Machine Learning Model Selection
Validation and Testing
